// Input: adjList = [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
// Output: [[2,4],[1,3],[2,4],[1,3]]
// Explanation: There are 4 nodes in the graph.
// 1st node (val = 1)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
// 2nd node (val = 2)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
// 3rd node (val = 3)'s neighbors are 2nd node (val = 2) and 4th node (val = 4).
// 4th node (val = 4)'s neighbors are 1st node (val = 1) and 3rd node (val = 3).
// Input: adjList = [[]]
// Output: [[]]
// Explanation: Note that the input contains one empty list. The graph consists of only one node with val = 1 and it does not have any neighbors.
// Example 3:

// Input: adjList = []
// Output: []
// Explanation: This an empty graph, it does not have any nodes.
