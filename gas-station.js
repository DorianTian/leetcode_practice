// Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
// Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
// Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
// Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
// Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
// Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
// Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
